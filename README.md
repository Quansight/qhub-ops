# QHub-Ops

Is a tool for initializing and maintaining the state of QHub
deployments on Digital Ocean, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud
Platform.

## Installation:

```bash
pip install qhub-ops
```

## Configuration

QHub is entirely controlled from a configuration file. Example
configuration files can be found in
[tests/assets](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub-ops/tree/master/tests/assets). Documentation
on creating a configuration file is detailed [here](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub-ops/blob/master/qhub_ops/template/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.repo_directory%20%7D%7D/docs/configuration.md).

Templates for each file are at the following paths:
  - AWS :: tests/assets/config_aws.yaml
  - DO  :: tests/assets/config_do.yaml
  - GCP :: tests/assets/config_gcp.yaml

## Initializing the Provider Template

The exact naming of the configuration file is needed to trigger the CI
actions when the configuration is changed.

```bash
mkdir <repository-name>
# mv <config-filename> <repository-name>/qhub-ops-config.yaml
qhub-ops render -c <repository-name>/qhub-ops-config.yaml -o <repository-name>/ --force
```

After initialising the provider templates, follow the instructions in
docs on deploying the infrastructure at
`<repository-name>/docs/installation.md`. At this current moment some
bootstrapping is required before github-actions can manage the
infrastructure as code. All of these instructions are automated in
`scripts/00-guided-install.sh`. Note that you will need to set the
environment variables in `intallation.md` for this script to
succeed. You will be prompted several times for use actions such as
setting oauth provider and dns.

```bash
scripts/00-guided-install.sh
```

## Terraform Module Dependencies

This project depends on the terraform modules repository:
https://github.com/Quansight/qhub-terraform-modules

## Architecture

To generate them, just run the following command:

```bash
